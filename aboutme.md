I am Harald, living in a small town called Illertissen near Ulm in Germany - Earth. 

I have 4 cute kids, a wife and a dog.

What else do you need to know?

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just get in touch with me via social media links in the footer of this page?
