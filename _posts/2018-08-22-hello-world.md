This is my first post, how exciting!
After years of not publishing anything I'd like to put new life into my blog.

*Hello World!* - Again

Recently I was little shocked by the amount of "advertising" on my (free of charge) [wordpress blogs](http://haraldweber.wordpress.com).
Especially if you access your blow with a mobile device, the ads take nearly 50% of available screen space.

Maybe I should by a bigger phone?

Next try: Github pages (free).
It's easy to create an account, fork an existing theme and create new posts via browser.
I's quite a learning curve to understand how github & git work, but at the end I found a reasonable workflow to maintain this blog.

Will write about the workflow in a separate post soon :)
