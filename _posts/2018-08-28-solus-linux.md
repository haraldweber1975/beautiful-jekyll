If you're a linux fanboy and want to try out a new desktop oriented linux distribution, continue to read my review of Solus Linux.

## Intro
Installing a linux distribution is sort of a hobby for me. Recently I discovered a very nice project about a _desktop oriented_ linux distribution which is **not** based on Ubuntu / Debain / Slack.

[Solus Project](http://solus-project.com). 

## My use case
I always ask myself: Is it suitable for my parents?

## Installation
Solus comes in 3 editions. Budgie, Mate, Gnome - I have chosen the "Budgie" edition simply 'cause I have the impression this is where the developers put most effort in

## First Impression
It is starting fast - really fast!
### Clean UI
### Appstore
### Searching
### Updates

## Installing useful tools
Solus comes with a vast number of installed applications like 
- Libre office
