No matter if you're a linux fanbox or a newbie: If you want to try out a new desktop oriented linux distribution that even beats the great [Elementary OS](http://elementary.io), continue to read my review of Solus Linux.

## Intro
Installing a linux distribution is sort of a hobby for me. Recently I discovered a very nice project about a _desktop oriented_ linux distribution which is **not** based on Ubuntu / Debain / Slack.

[Solus Project](http://solus-project.com). 

## My use case
I always ask myself: Is it suitable for my parents?
### OS lifecylce? Enf of support? Not with rolling release Solus
Every OS has its lifecycle and after Windows XP reached the end of its live I moved my parents on Elementary OS as they didn't want to pay for a copy of Windows 7.

Now after approx 4 years it's time to install a new version of Elementary - no need for that if you're using a rolling-release Operating System like Solus. **Install once - upgrade forever**.

### Remote support

### Zero maintenance

## Installation
Solus comes in 3 editions. Budgie, Mate, Gnome - I have chosen the "Budgie" edition simply 'cause I have the impression this is where the developers put most effort in

## First Impression
It is starting fast - really fast!
### Clean UI
### Appstore (Software Center)
### Searching
### Updates

## Installing additional software
Solus comes with a **vast number** of installed applications like 
- **Libre office** which will cover all your "office" needs like writing, presenting, calculating and drawing 
- **Archive Manager** to handle ZIP archives
- **Firefox or WEB** to browser the web
- **Thunderbird** for emails
- **Image Viewer** to view images (surprise surprise)
- **Rhythmbox** to listen to your music
- **Files** to manage your files (another surprising name)
- **Videos** to view ... guess what

I installed additional applications to make the system even more suitable for my needs.

- **Alber** to quickly search applications, basic math and quick translations without leaving the keyboard
- **Geary** a beautiful email client (I knew this one from Elementary OS)
- **Opera** to browse the web with style // adblocker // vpn
- **Dropbox** online storage with easy sharing options
- **Enpass** to manage the 174 passwords I have
- **Skype** to do cross-platform text / video chats
- **Steam** for basic gaming (hardware is not suitable for latest 3D Shooters)
- **AnyDesk** to manage machines remotely
- **Etcher** the easiest tool to write ISO images on USB thumb drives
- **Oracle Virtualbox** to run virtual machines on linux
- **gthumb Image Viewer** enables you to not only view, but also crop / resize / optimize pictures

### SNAP support (similar to .EXE files on Windows)
## what about services like Squid / Nextcloud / nginx / Apache...
If you're using an Ubuntu based system you have access to literaly millians of packages.
For the majority of end-users it's simply too much. Therefore I appreciate the approach of Solus to NOT integrate as many services as possible. There are other Linux distributions for that.

I was playing around with docker by accident and guess what - it's also available on Solus.
My way to install a "Service" on Solus is simply utilizing Docker / Docker-Compose. Works great and keeps your system clean and lean (no need to install a huge number of dependencies on your Desktop PC).

## Resume
I like it so much - I even installed the OS bare-metal on an older notebook (with a SSD drive) and didn't regret it. The next linux distribution I'll install on my parent's PC will be Solus of course.

THANK YOU SOLUS TEAM FOR YOUR INCREDIBLE WORK!!
