If you're a linux fanboy and want to try out a new desktop oriented linux distribution, continue to read my review of Solus Linux.

## Intro
Installing a linux distribution is sort of a hobby for me. Recently I discovered a very nice project about a _desktop oriented_ linux distribution which is **not** based on Ubuntu / Debain / Slack.

[Solus Project](http://solus-project.com). 

## My use case
I always ask myself: Is it suitable for my parents?

## Installation
Solus comes in 3 editions. Budgie, Mate, Gnome - I have chosen the "Budgie" edition simply 'cause I have the impression this is where the developers put most effort in

## First Impression
It is starting fast - really fast!
### Clean UI
### Appstore (Software Center)
### Searching
### Updates

## Installing additional software
Solus comes with a **vast number** of installed applications like 
- Libre office
- 
In addition I installed these applications:
Searching / App launcher: Albert
Email Client: Geary
Browser: Opera
Password manager: Enpass
Communication: Skype
Gaming: Steam
Remote support: AnyDesk
ISO image handling: Etcher
Virtualisation: Oracle VM VirtualBox
Picture editing: gthumb Image Viewer

### SNAP support (similar to .EXE files on Windows)
## Solus is Desktop oriented - so what about services like SMB / Squid / etc...
I was playing around with docker by accident and guess what - it's also available on Solus.

My way to install a "Service" on Solus is simply utilizing Docker / Docker-Compose. Working great!

## Resume
I like it so much - I even installed the OS bare-metal on an older notebook (with a SSD drive) and didn't regreg it. The next linux distribution I'll install on my parent's PC will be solus of course.
